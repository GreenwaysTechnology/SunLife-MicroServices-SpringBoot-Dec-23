Network based Applications - Distributed Application

Application has layers:

1.User interface layer
2.Application biz layer
3.Data Layer /Repository layer

Histrory of Architecture of Distributed Application

Distributed means, application is broken into multiple parts and each part put into multiple hosts/machines, connect those via network.

1.Mainframework based distributed
   1.Application biz layer
   2.Data Layer /Repository layer
 Where as User interface layer is kept in dump terminals connected to mainframworks.

Drawbacks:
1.Too costly
2.scalability is too difficult.


Advantage:
1.High security
2.Centeralized management.

2.Client Server Architecture

2.1.Main framework based client -server , where as mainframe acts as server and digital computers act as clients.
 
2.2.Digital computer based client - server architechture
   Servers and clients are digital computers

Based on this we can classify the applications  layered /tiered concept


1.single tier/layer
   client,server,database every is kept in one single machine...
2.two tier/layer
  user interface is kept in client machine,
  data logic and biz logic is kept in server machine
 both machines are connected via networks

          "This arch based on LAN /WAN"

3.three tier /layer

 This arch based on "internet network" and web computing

   client - client machine
   server - biz logic is kept inside another machine
   database - is kept inside another machine

 Client is browser
 Server BIZ logic is kept as "web Applications"
 Database is accessed by "Server side technologies - J2EE,ASP/.net,PHP,....

4.N-tier / layer

 Client is browser
 Server BIZ logic is kept as "web Applications"
   -Again spilt into multi layered
 Database is accessed by "Server side technologies - J2EE,ASP/.net,PHP,....
 In 2000 , J2EE introduced n-tier client server  

  browser -------web application(servlets/jsp)----EJB----Messaging/Databases(JMS/JDBC/Middlewares)

 Spring based N-tier client server arch:

  browser -------web application(spring mvc)---Spring serivices----Spring data----Messaging/Databases(JMS/JDBC/Middlewares)
.....................................................................................
		    How to build N-tier distributed Applications
.....................................................................................

Steps/Process:

1.Domain Modeling

  Banking, Online Food Delivery App, Ecommerce Domain

2.Select technology

   if your app is based on web and internet.
  Steps:
   1. Database -  Oracle 
   2. MOM - RabbitMQ,IBM MQ,Microsoft MQ
   3. Development Technology
       Java/JEE  - Why you go with specific implmentation technologies?
       .Net
       Php

3.Development and release methodology
   Waterfall -  traditional dev , release


Any domain consist of various modules
 -Accounts
 -Loans
 -Customers
 -Card
etc.....
 
4.Testing
   Once the development is over, the app is going to be under testing

5.Production
   Once the app is tested fully, ready for production.

6.Maintance
   Once the app in the production, it goes on maintaince...

if any app is built based on the above methodology, which is called as "Monolithic"
.....................................................................................
 Challanges in the application development,testing,relase,Production,maintaince
....................................................................................


1.Every thing has to go step by step -  this increase cost , time waste,resource waste

Companies like Amazon,Netflix who wanted fast development,test,release,maintaince : Dynamic  methodology to build applications -  No downtime,
One module takes more time ,another module takes less time, because of one module , other module should not wait.

2.Technology bottleneck - Mono technology
 
 The whole application is built using single technology - Java - vendor lock
 The whole application targets single database - Oracle /Mysql/Microsoft SQL server..

3.Employing security layer is more complicated

4.Deployment / Production.

   The dev and prod env is completly different
   Bare deployment models
   VM based deployment...

...................................................................................
			  New way of building apps


1.Automatation is key concept 

   to anays,dev,test,release,prod,maintaince

Agile :(Requirement Analysis)

  Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments

Breaks the application into smaller and smaller.
 - fast delivery with quality on time.


Requirments are highly dynamic, cant be freezed,since it is dynamic start development,test,release,deploy peridically.


We need automation, through which  automatically only we can achive fast delivery -
 in order to automate, a new technology was created "Dev Ops" - Dev + Operations togther.

Distributed source code repo - git

Pipe lines tools  - 
   Jenkins -(Continuous Integration)

Requirement---> Dev---push the code to source code repo---|CI Tool---Compile--Build/pack--Testing-Deployment(CD)

Every thing is here Continuous happens

Continuous Req Analysis
Continuous Dev 
Continuous release /build
Continuous test
Continuous release /build
Continuous deployment
Continuous tracing and monitoring

This process applied on every module in the applications
OrderManagement 
   Continuous Req Analysis,Dev,release,test,deployment,tracing,monitoring

CustomerManagement 
   Continuous Req Analysis,Dev,release,test,deployment,tracing,monitoring


if any app is built based on the above methodology, that application is called as 				  "MicroService"

	     How to convert existing monolithic apps into microservices
.....................................................................................

Scalling means expanding either software or hardware resources..
if you scale software- horiziontal
if you scale hardware -vertical 

Why Scale Cube?

Increase performance
Make you app highly available..

X,Z => Scale instance of your app

X- based on Built in routing algorthims
Z- Custom routing algorthims

Assume that your app is already running in production,based on Monolithic model,
You have applied X scalling, that means your monolith app is running multiple instances.

Next step, you got assigment, you have to convert existing application(monolithic) into microservices?

How to begin?
 Apply scale cube pattern........ Y scalling 


Y-Axis scalling talks about how to spilt the existing monolith  application into micro services based on "functionals aspects" - Service


A Service is a "mini application" that implmements narrowly focused functionality.
Such as orderManagement,customer Management, and so on....

Some services are scalled based on "X-axis" and some services are "Z-scalling".


Your App
   -Y scalling
       -X or Z scalling....

The high level definition of microservices architecture(microservices) is an architectural style that "functionally decomposes an application into set of services(mini applcation)

In Monlolith app the app is broken into "modules" where as microservice break as services(mini application)..


What Microservices offers?

1.Microservices offers "form of modularity"
2.Each service has its own database - Customer Service may use "Mongodb'
  where as payment service may use "Oracle database"

Benefits of the microservice architecture

 It enables the continuous delivery and deployment of large, complex applications.
 Services are small and easily maintained.
 Services are independently deployable.
 Services are independently scalable.
 The microservice architecture enables teams to be autonomous.
 It allows easy experimenting and adoption of new technologies.
 It has better fault isolation

			How to design and implment microservices

The microservices is all about practices followed,implemented, and tested in real time production grade applications in various companies like amazon,netflix,google,microsoft.

The many community people joined  togther who formed the pattern language in order to begin development of Microservices - Microservice pattern language, design patterns
.....................................................................................
	      Decision Pointers when start building app


Step : 0 - May be for new Application(new Requirement) or existing Application
			
Requriment for building online food delivery:
	
1.You are developing a server-side enterprise application.

2.It must support a variety of different clients including desktop browsers, mobile browsers and native mobile applications. 

3.The application might also expose an API for 3rd parties to consume.

4.It might also integrate with other applications via either web services or a message broker.

5.The application handles requests (HTTP requests and messages) by executing business logic; accessing a database; exchanging messages with other systems; and returning a HTML/JSON/XML response. 

6.There are logical components corresponding to different functional areas of the application.

			How to design and implment microservices

The microservices is all about practices followed,implemented, and tested in real time production grade applications in various companies like amazon,netflix,google,microsoft.

The many community people joined togther who formed the pattern language in order to begin development of Microservices - Microservice pattern language.
.....................................................................................
			  Pattern Languages
.....................................................................................

Pattern is a resuable soultion to  a problem that occurs in a particular context.

Christopher Alexander writings inspired the software community to adopt the concept of patterns and patterns language, The book Design patterns: Elements of Resuable Object oriented Sofware - GOF patterns.


Elements of patterns.

Every Pattern has sections

1.Forces
2.Result Context
3.Related patterns

Forces: The issues that you must address when  sovling a problem.

 The forces section of a pattern describes the forces(issues) that you must address when solving a problem in a given context.

Sometimes forces can conflict, so it might not be possible to solve all of them.

Which issues(forces) are more important dependens on the context.

eg:

When you write code in a reactive style , has better performance than non reactive sync code.
But it more difficult to understand.

Resulting Context:
..................
 The force section of a pattern describes issues(forces) that must address when a solving a problem in a given context.

The result context section of a pattern describes the consequences(advantages and disadvantages) of applying the pattern.

It consistts of three parts

1.Befnifits: 
   The benefits of the pattern, including the forces that have been resolved.
2.Drawbacks:
   The drawbacks of the pattern, including, un resolved forces.
3.Issues
    The new Prolmes that have been introduced by applying the pattern.

The result ing context provides a more complete and less biased view of the solution
which enables better decisions.

Related Patterns:
 The related patterns describe the relationship between the pattern and other patterns.


There are five types of relationship between patterns.

Predecessor – a predecessor pattern is a pattern that motivates the need for this pattern. For example, the Microservice Architecture pattern is the predecessor to the rest of the patterns in the pattern language except the monolithic architecture pattern

if i have selected microservice, then only i can think about other patterns of microserivce else i cant.

Successor – a pattern that solves an issue that is introduced by this pattern. 
For example, if you apply the Microservice Architecture pattern you must then apply numerous successor patterns including service discovery patterns and the Circuit Breaker pattern.

Alternative – a pattern that provides an alternative solution to this pattern. For example, the Monolithic Architecture pattern and the Microservice Architecture pattern are alternative ways of architecting an application. You pick one or the other.

Generalization: - A Pattern that is a general soultion to a problem for eg if you want to host a service , we have different implementations like single serivce per host pattern, single service on multiple hosting etc...

Specialiation: - A specialized form of  a particular pattern -  For eg deploy a service as container pattern is spacilzation of a single service per host.

		   Microservice arichitecture pattern language
...................................................................................  
The Microservice pattern language is a collection of patterns that help you architect an application using the microservice architectures.

Infrastructure Patterns:
  Thses solves problems that are mostly infrastructure issues outside of development.

Application patterns:
  These are for related to development

Application Infrastructure:
   Application related infrastructures like containers

If you are going to build online store.

Business capability:
Product Catalog Management
Inventory Management
Order Management
Delivery Management.

Alternate Pattern

Decompose by SubDomain:
 Decompose the problem based on DDD principles.

....................................................................................
				Data Management
....................................................................................

Core Pattern:
1.Database Per Service Pattern
2.Shared Database

Note:
  if you take any data related patterns, "Transactions" are very important.


1.Database Per Service Pattern leads/succeeds other patterns
  Domain Event

     or
    3.Polling publisher

   2.1.Idemponent Consumer
.....................................................................................
			Communication Style Patterns
...................................................................................

Service = Mini Application

MiniApplication = Collection of Programs

Collection of programs in Java = Collections of classes

Collections of classes = Collections Objects.

Object/Class = Collection of  state and behaviour

State = data
Behaviour=methods

Object = methods

methods = API

API will DO three things

1.write - update,remove,insert
2.read
3.process

class OrderService {

   @Autowrited
   private OrderRepository orderRepo;
   //API
   public List<Order> findAll(){
	orderRepo.findAll()
   }
 
}

Types of API:
1.local api
   api which are called with in same runtime by other apis
2.remote api
  api which are called outside runtime via networks 

How to build remote api?

 Based on protocals

1.HTTP Protocal.

 if you design your api based on HTTP protcal, those apis are called as "WebServices"

Web Service:
  RESTFull WebServices

REST API = Program

In java => classes

In Web Services classes are called "End Points"

In Micro services -Services can be  represented as "WebServices"

Rest WebService------>http-----RestWebservice => HTTP based Microservice

Rest WebService------>http-----Graphql => HTTP based Microservice

Rest WebService------>http/2 over tcp------GRpc Service=> TCP based Microservice

Rest Web Service ---->TCP/MOM-------------->Messaging Service -Middlewares

Communication Sytle patterns:

1.RPI patterns
   REST,gRPC,Apache Thrift - RPI implementations
2.Messaging
   Any Messaging middlewares - RabbitMQ,IBM MQ,MicroSoft MQ - MQTT,AMQP
   Streaming platforms - Apache Kafka,Confluent Kafka
   2.1.Idemponent Consumer
3.Domain Specfic Protocal
   SMTP - Mail Service   

.....................................................................................
			   Deployment Patterns
.....................................................................................

Once the services(applications) are ready, we can move the application into production.

Production Related Patterns:

Deployment Environment/Plattforms

1.Bare Metal 
    Where as physical hardware, and operating system, Where we can provision our application.
    If you deploy java application.

  OS: Linux
  JRE- 17
  WebContainer -Tomcat
  Databases -MySql
  Streaming Platforms-Kafka
   
2.Virutal Machine 
   Oracle Virtual box 
    on VM , you can install os-linux
  JRE- 17
   WebContainer -Tomcat
   Databases -MySql
   Streaming Platforms-Kafka

3.Containerized Deployment
    It is lightweight vm - Docker and Kubernets
   JRE- 17
   WebContainer -Tomcat
   Databases -MySql
   Streaming Platforms-Kafka
  
4.Cloud 
   ->VM /container/bare 
  you can just deploy your app only,
  cloud may give you all softwares for you...


  "Cloud with containers are most preferable deployment for microservices"

Design patterns:

Bare Metal:
 1.Multiple services instances per host
 2.Service instance per host
VM
 1.Service instance Per VM
Container
 1.Service instance per Container
Cloud
 1.server less deployment
 2.Service deployment platform
 3.container and cloud

			      
		if your app deployement is in container 
				  or 
    			       in cloud
				  or 
			   Container with cloud
				 or 
			   in any Virtualized Env

if any micro service(application) is running in containerized env like kubernets(docker).

Challanges:
 1.suppose the application is accessed by other application or external application
   we need to communicate the application with help of "host:port".
 if application is running Virtualized env, "host and port" is not static,it would be dynamic.

 if it is dynamic then how other microservices, and external application, how they can communicate.
			
To solve the problem of identifying the services which are running in Virtualized env
 
				Advanced Communication Patterns
				(Service Registry and Discovery)


When we apply this pattern, services never communicate "directly", because they dont know each other due to "dynamic location",so they use broker to communicate, broker will have all service information-Service Registry

Service Registry Patterns:

1.Client side service Discovery
2.Server-side service Discovery
   ->Service Registry
  	->Self Registration
   	->ThridParty Registration

.....................................................................................
                     Services are running in Virtualized Env
		     Services are talking via Service Registry
		What if i any service is down / Slow / Throwing Exception
					
Microservices provides a Design patterns to handle failures and slow calls

			 Service Reliablity Patterns

1.Timeout Pattern
2.Bulk Head Pattern
3.Retry Pattern
4.Circuit Breaker Patterns
.....................................................................................
			    Configuration Data and Its patterns


Every application which requires configuration data,the configuration data may be connection strings,api tokens,application settings etc...

In Java application, configuration data is kept inside properties or yml files...

What if in micro serivces, the configuration is need to be shared across the application?

We have design pattern to centeralize configuration data/information.

1.Microservice Chassis
2.Service Templates
3.Externalized COnfiguration
.....................................................................................
		   Micro services are ready in production
			Now we need to expose to
		 other Applications- User interface applications

Microservices provide you a design pattern, called

External API patterns:

1.API Gate ways
  2.Back End for FrontEnd

.....................................................................................
		     Micro services are ready in production
		We have exposed our microservices via API Gateways
			  How to secure them?

Security Patterns

1.Access Tokens
   -Authentecation
   -Authrozation
   -SSL
   -Policies
....................................................................................
			Now your Micro service is in Production
				Next what should i do
			     Your App in Maintaince 

Monitor Your apps......
